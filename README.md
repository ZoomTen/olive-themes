# Olive-Editor Themes

This is a repo for Qt CSS themes made for [Olive Video Editor](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive).

## Installation
* Clone or Download -> Download ZIP
* Extract the ZIP file into a directory of your choosing. A folder named `olive-themes-master` should be there after the extraction.

## Applying the Themes
* Open Olive Video Editor, then go to Preferences.
* Go to the Appearance tab, then click `Browse` next to `Custom CSS`.
* Navigate to the directory where you put the repo's folder.
* Go to the `stylesheets` folder in `olive-themes-master`.
* Pick a `qss` file, click Open.
* Click OK. Olive should warn about a restart.
* Click Yes, and save your work.
* The theme should be applied to Olive at this point. How it looks depends on your operating system and Qt 5 settings.

## Contributing
Fork the repo, write your QSS file in the `stylesheets` directory, and create a [pull request](https://github.com/zoomten/olive-themes/pulls). It may take time for it to be merged.

If possible, please create a screenshot for your theme! This will help users to see what Olive will look like after applying your theme. You should place the screenshot in the `preview` directory.
